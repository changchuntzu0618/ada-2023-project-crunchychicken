## Idea 1: Temporal evolution of movie genres and their geographical variation
Since the invention of cinema at the end of the 19th century, the popularity of film genres has evolved over time. It would be relevant to identify peaks in popularity and trends specific to each genre. In addition, an analysis by genre and by area in the world could prove interesting to understand how trends evolve from a geographical point of view. For example, it would be relevant to study whether the biggest box-office hits released in one country influence film genre choices in other countries in subsequent years. To do this, the use of movie metadata, including genre, country of production and release date, would be useful. One approach would be to group countries by continent, allowing trends in genres over time to be visualized by continent. Graphs could be used to identify peaks in popularity and trends in different film genres.

## Idea 2: Create a model to predict movie box office revenues
My second idea would be to create a machine learning model to predict the box office revenues of films based on their characteristics. For example, the model could take into account the actors, the film's genre, the release date and the language of the film, and use this data to predict the revenue. To do this, the dataset needs to be divided into three parts: one part to train the model, a second to validate it and a third to test it. The validation and training stages will enable us to evaluate the model's performance. We can then predict box office revenues in the test phase.

## Idea 3: In-Depth Analysis of Film Actors
My third idea is to carry out an in-depth analysis of actors in films. Firstly, we could look at how actors' gender has changed over time. Secondly, it would be interesting to assess whether actors tend to play mainly in the same film genre or whether they explore very different roles, while examining whether their popularity influences this dynamic. To do this, we could assess the popularity of actors by taking into account the number of times they appear in the data. In addition, it would be relevant to take into account the age of the actor between their first and last film, as this could also be an indicator of their popularity. Next, we could establish correlations between the popularity of actors and the number of different film genres in which they play, and analyse whether any trends emerge. Finally, we could study whether an actor's popularity influences box-office revenues.

## Idea 1
The goal of your analysis is unclear. You are proposing to make multiple analysis but without a precise goal. Moreover, you are just proposing to run different time series which is quite basic and won’t allow you to reveal all you ADA skills.

## Idea 2
Here again the goal of your analysis is not defined. The most important question in such project is the purpose. What do you want to understand with such analysis? This is the a very vicious trap of ML: we build a super accurate model but we don’t show anything with it.

## Idea 3
Here as well, you propose to run various analysis on actor data but you are not answering to any research question
