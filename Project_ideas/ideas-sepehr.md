# IDEAS

## 1. How does the relationship of people shape the movie industry?
The production of a movie involves a collaboration between a variety of roles for a relatively long period of time, and they all influence the success of the movie. The quality of the plot and the acting are of course an important factor, but there are details that are often more difficult to discern. When a team of directors, producers, writers, cinematographers, etc. collaborate, the result is more than just one movie. They build a relationship, good or bad, and it will influence their future projects and decisions. By building a network graph of the relationship of the most important people in the movie industry (using the CMU, IMDb, and DBpedia datasets), we can analyze it to get more insights about how these relationships have influenced the industry. Who are the most influential figures? Is there any pattern in the success of a movie and the relationship of people among the production team? Is there any pattern in the emergence of a new star or the disappearance of a popular figure?

## 2. Is she really acting or she is just being herself?
Certain actors and actresses are known to have performed diverse roles and different characters, while some are criticized for repeating themselves. By analyzing the characters and persona that have been portrayed by an actor or an actress, the importance of their role, their age at the time of the movie, potentially their personal state at the time, and a measure of their popularity or success, we can answer to the question whether there is a pattern in the career paths of actors and actresses in terms of the types of roles that they perform.

## 3. How does the directorial style of directors evolve throughout their career?
Stanley Kubrick is known to have at least one great movie in every major movie genre. On the other hand, when you see David Fincher's name as the director of a new movie, you are almost sure that there is going to be one or more serial killers involved. But how is it for less-known directors? The directorial style of an average director evolves over time. Their experiences, their personal life, their emotional state, and many other factors might influence their style. It is not easy to put together all these factors, but we can analyze the types of movies that they have directed throughout their career and see if there are patterns in the career of a director. Several aspects such as the movie genre, the character types, the activity rate (e.g., movies per 5 years) of the director, the popularity of the movie cast, the budget of the movie, and the success of the movie can be analyzed.

## 4. What factors affect the success of a movie?
- Popularity of the cast
- Budget
- Popularity of the director
