## First idea: Actor's Preference of Character and Corresponding Revenue
In a movie, a character's success isn't solely about the story; it also heavily depends on how the actor brings that character to life. This raises the question: what kinds of characters do actors really like to play? Do they stick to the same types of roles every time, or do they enjoy experimenting with different characters? We can analyze and categorize the various characters played by actors and actresses. Then, we can try to find out the preference of each actor/actress depend on gender and nationality.  Do the actors/actress in some countries have more preference towards some type of characters? Moreover, how do these choices affect the outcome (the movie box revenue)? Does an actor's preference for a certain character type always lead to greater success, or are there cases where a particular character type doesn't quite click with an actor's style?  Additionally, are there actors and actresses who do well in various character types and how rare it is?

## Second idea: Child Stars
In the world of movies, young actors often have special careers. They start their career at an early stage of life but can leave the movie industry in various ages. We want to study how long these child stars stay in the spotlight and how much money their movies make throughout different period of their career. It’s also interesting to know what age period is usually a peak time for the child star. Is the early stage of their career or the later period? Moreover, is there the case of a child star who is successful in his/her whole career in movie industry for a long period or it is hard for a child star to maintain the popularity throughout his/her career life. 

## Third idea: Decoding Movie Success: What Makes a Film a Hit?
In the movie world, figuring out why some films become super popular is like solving an interesting puzzle. We want to take that puzzle apart and find out if the kind of movie (like action or comedy), the characters, the story, or the actors are the most important for a movie's success. Moreover, are the keys to success is different from country to country or there are things that work all around the world.  It can show the regional trend and also global trend of movie.

# TA feedback
## Idea 1: 
The questions addressed are interesting but some things remain unclear: How do you plan to categorize the characters played? 
## Idea 2: 
Great question!! How would you characterize ‘being in the spotlight’ or the ‘peak time’? 
## Idea 3: 
A bit less creative and clear than the 2 first ideas. You don’t detail how you would proceed from a data analysis perspective whereas it is the goal of this project!
