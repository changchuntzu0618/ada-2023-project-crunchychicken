## First idea: Gender equality in cinematography
Historically, cinema's portrayal of women was often confined within stereotypical boundaries. Females were restricted to roles that showcased them as housewives or love interests. However, as society progressed and the fight for gender equality gathered momentum and the cinematic universe began to reflect these shifts. Recent decades have witnessed an evident transformation in the roles assigned to women. No longer confined to the sidelines, females are now at the forefront, occupying central narratives, and frequently being portrayed as strong, independent, and intellectual characters. By analyzing the CMU corpus, we'll trace this evolution, marking gradual progression from peripheral roles to dominant narratives for women. We'll further evaluate the depth and diversity of these roles, ensuring that modern representations are not just quantitatively more but also qualitatively richer. Using external data sources like IMDb, we'll also assess the recognition of these roles in terms of awards, nominations, and critical acclaims. The goal is to highlight the cinematic journey of female characters from mere caricatures to comprehensive, multifaceted personalities that mirror the real-world evolution of women's roles in society.

## Second idea: Influence of global events on movie plots
To gauge the impact of global happenings on cinema, we'll delve into the influences of wars, technological innovations, economic downturns, and even subtle governmental nudges. Historical events like the Cold War didn't just shape global politics but also cinematic narratives. Was there a spike in war-centric movies during such times or narratives where American protagonists found themselves fighting against foreign threats, suggesting possible governmental influence or propaganda? Moreover, with the advent of groundbreaking technology like CGI, did the film industry lean more towards alien invasions or space odysseys? And in times of economic crises, did cinema try to uplift spirits by churning out more comedies, offering a respite from real-world struggles? We could explore patterns in movie genres, plots, and even the nationalities of lead actors. Did certain global events lead to a particular nationality being more represented, or possibly even typecast, in specific roles? Were certain genres more predominant in specific decades due to overarching global sentiments?

## Third idea: Globalization of movies
Explore the evolution of international film collaborations from their sparse existence at the dawn of the 20th century to the prolific global partnerships we witness today. By analyzing movies that have cross-border production teams or casts, is the democratization of these collaborations truly equitable? For instance, does the main cast predominantly hail from one nationality when a developed country collaborates with an emerging one? Do all nationalities get equal spotlight and access to awards? Are some nationalities stigmatized? Another intriguing facet is the global reach of cinema from various regions. While Hollywood films enjoy global viewership, other robust industries like Bollywood might not have the same global footprint. Why is there such a disparity, and how have these dynamics changed over time?

# TA feedback
## Idea 1: 
Great and complete idea, interesting to add the IMDb dataset! Minor comment: it could have been nice to be more precise on how you want to measure the depth and diversity of a role. 
## Idea 2: 
Good idea but you are not leveraging many of your ADA skills to answer this question. Try to be more creative on the data analysis part! 
## Idea 3: 
Interesting question, especially the Hollywood/Bollywood comparison! Be careful although when comparing country-specific metrics such as awards that can be highly biased towards one country.
