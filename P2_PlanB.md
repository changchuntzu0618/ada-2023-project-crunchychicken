# Plan B: Is she really acting or she is just being herself?
# Abstract
**(to be deleted)A 150 word description of the project idea and goals. What’s the motivation behind your project? What story would you like to tell, and why?

In a movie, a character's success isn't solely about the story; it also heavily depends on how the actor brings that character to life. This raises the question: what kinds of characters do actors really like to play? Certain actors and actresses are known to have performed diverse roles and different characters, while some are criticized for repeating themselves. By analyzing the characters and persona that have been portrayed by an actor or an actress, the importance of their role, their age at the time of the movie, a measure of their popularity or success, and the countries, we can answer to the question whether there is a pattern in the career paths of actors and actresses in terms of the types of roles that they perform. 

# Research Questions

3. Do the actors or actress in some countries have more preference towards some types of characters? 
4. How do the choices of chracter's type affect the outcome or the popularity of the actors or actress?
5. Does an actor's preference for a certain character type always lead to greater success, or are there cases where a particular character type doesn't quite click with an actor's style? 
6. Are there actors and actresses who do well in various character types and how rare it is?
