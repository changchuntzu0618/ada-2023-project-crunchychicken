We can divide our content into posts and create files like this.

The date in the file name is important since Jekyll requires this format to
recognize it as a post.

We have three options to design our content:
  1. Write the whole story in index.md (no posts / pages)
  2. Write a post for each research questions
  3. Write multiple posts for each research question and put them in the same categories

**SEPEHR:** My pereferred option is 2.
It allows us to work at the same time on separate files and
is easy to follow for the reader in the end.
