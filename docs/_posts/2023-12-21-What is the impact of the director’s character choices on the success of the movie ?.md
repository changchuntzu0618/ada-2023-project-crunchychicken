We're familiar with the notion that a director's success often hinges on their selection of characters in a movie. Yet, what types of characters do accomplished directors gravitate towards? How varied are directors in their choices of characters? Can we identify highly successful directors who consistently lean towards specific character types, and conversely, those who exhibit a broad spectrum in their character selections? Moreover, does the choice of characters significantly influence a movie's success? This section aims to delve into these questions and uncover the intricate connections between directors' character choices and the ultimate success of both the directors and their films.
