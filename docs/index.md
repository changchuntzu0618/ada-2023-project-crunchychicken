## **Abstract**

Stanley Kubrick is known to have at least one great movie in every major movie genre. Conversely, when you see David Fincher's name as the director of a new movie, you are almost sure that there is going to be one or more serial killers involved. The directorial approach of the most successful directors can be so different and taking the right directorial approaches early can lead a director to achieve significant success in their career, and is believed to be the main factor determining the quality of the movie. In this data analysis project, we will utilize the CMU Movie Summary Corpus, along with supplementary datasets, to examine approaches of the brightest directors from three angles: the genre of their films, the team surrounding them, and the character personas in their movies. We aim to gain a clear insight on how their decisions impact the overall success of the movie.
