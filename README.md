# P3: Final project and the datastory

When you are done with Homework H2, in Milestone P3 you will execute the project you proposed. For the final milestone, you will be expected to execute your project proposal and describe your project in a data story.

Data stories are a blog post or short article, with an important visual component, using data to tell a story and illustrate it effectively. You can be less formal here (although methods and math should then appear in the notebook), but more visual. Please look at the top-k projects from 2022, 2021, 2020, and 2019 as a reference for designing good data stories. You can pick your preferred platform option, but we encourage you to use Jekyll. We prepared a short tutorial for creating a website with GitHub pages outlining how you can host the datastory. You submit the story by providing a URL to it in your README file.

A Jupyter notebook extending the one delivered for Milestone P2 is also expected and will be graded. The README in Milestone P3 shall be updated. It should also detail the contributions of all group members.

Example
John: Plotting graphs during data analysis, crawling the data, preliminary data analysis
Mary: Problem formulation, coming up with the algorithm
Chris: Coding up the algorithm, running tests, tabulating final results
Eve: Writing up the report or the data story, preparing the final presentation

There will be project office hours dedicated to helping you finish the project successfully. The bulk of your work will be over before the winter break, so you can focus on the exam (and exams of other classes) during that time.

P3 deliverables (done as a team):

1. The final project repository containing your final notebook. We will grade the correctness, quality of code, and quality of textual descriptions. There should be a single Jupyter notebook containing the main logic. The implementation of helper functions that is not essential for understanding the main logic should be contained in external scripts/modules that will be called from the main notebook.

2. Data story
